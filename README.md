# Facebook Not Typing

This Chrome extension blocks Facebook from knowing that you're typing a comment or message. Downside is that tagging people in comments doesn't work, you might want to disable this extension in this case.

## Install

Download ZIP file, decompress, follow [Google's guide to install unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked), point the file chooser to the directory you just decompressed.

## Extra features

This extension was separated into [facebook-micromanage](https://github.com/pellaeon/facebook-micromanage). Users who only want to block type tracking only need this simple extension. facebook-micromanage contains extra features such as breaking the [Facebook filter bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble) and many more. (I hope this would strike Facebook angry and respect its users ;-) )
